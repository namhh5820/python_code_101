Local and Global Scope
     + Code in the global scope cannot use any local variables.

     + However, a local scope can access global variables.

     + Code in a functionâ€™s local scope cannot use variables in any other local scope.

     + You can use the same name for different variables if they are in different scopes. 
     That is, there can be a local variable named spam and a global variable also named spam.
